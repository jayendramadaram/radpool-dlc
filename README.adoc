== Radpool DLC Contracts

Radpool MSPs pay miners using a DLC contracts. The details are
documented on https://pool2win.github.io/radpool-design/1/index.html
and https://radpool.xyz.

This repository is the Rust implementation of the contracts and hosts
all detailed design decisions.

The first design decision is to figure how we capture the contract
terms - hashrate, btc and expiry.

Then we need provide a crate with APIs where the miner and MSP pubkeys
are provided as input. The API will return the Contract Execution
Transactions for the two parties.

Finally, we have a second API where the CETs are settled when the
Oracle (Syndicate) is available.
